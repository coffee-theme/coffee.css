# Coffee theme CSS bootstrap

This is a simple bootstrap for coffee theme for HTML and CSS,

-   \*.css files are not minified files
-   \*.min.css files are minified CSS files (recommended to use them)

# Bootstrap using HTML

## Download locally

-   Download one of the files, my recommended one is [coffee.min.css](/css/coffee.min.css) as it's the smallest
-   Link it using the `<link>` tag

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/coffee.min.css" />
```

## Hosted on GitHub

Add either of these to your HTML `<head>` tag:

-   Minimised CSS (recommended)

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coffee-theme/coffee.css/main/css/coffee.min.css"
/>
```

-   Full CSS

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coffee-theme/coffee.css/main/css/coffee.css"
/>
```

#### Same processes go for [coffee.css](/css/coffee.css)
